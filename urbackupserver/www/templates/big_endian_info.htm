	UrBackup is currently not tested on big endian systems and probably won't work.
	<br />
	UrBackup has been put into testing mode. This means UrBackup will
	<ul>
	<li>Always log debug messages</li>
	<li>Always verify file backups, causing slow file backups</li>
	</ul>
	If you want to help make UrBackup available on big endian systems please report all problems to the <a href="http://forums.urbackup.org">forums</a> 
	 or to our <a href="http://urbackup.atlassian.net/secure/">issue tracker</a>. Thank you for your help!
